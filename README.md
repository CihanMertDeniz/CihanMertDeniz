⚡ Software & Security Engineer Specializing in Systems, Automation, and Privacy

I design and build high-performance cross-platform software, security-focused tooling, privacy frameworks, virtualization-based sandboxes, secure data destruction utilities, real-time vulnerability analysis systems, and more across the wider systems and security ecosystem.

My work combines systems programming, cybersecurity research, automation pipelines, and developer tooling to create reliable, efficient, and security-driven solutions.
